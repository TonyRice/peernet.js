# peernet.js

peernet.js provides a simple pub/sub system built using OpenPGP and IPFS pubsub.

It was created as a simple way to send encrypted messages through
IPFS pubsub with acknowledgement of message delivery. It does this by 
using a simple message acknowledgement model that uses IPFS hashes rather
 than IPFS pubsub to detect the delivery of the message.

A peer can act as a sender, receiver, and a relay.
